# TODO

* The tab object should keep track of its extents.  Whenever they change, its extent properties should be updated.
 
 
 
* Need to build a function that allows you to 'add to' a style rather than fully overwrite it.  So inspect the existing style, copy it, but allow you to add or modify an attribute.
 For instance, numeric formatting needs to be applied on top of an existing style.
